# CS690 FinalProject - Book Log

This project is to create an program that addresses the scenario below:

**Scenario: A Day in the Life of Clara**

*Morning*

Clara sits at her favorite café, sipping her latte and flipping through a novel she started last week. “I’ve read five books this month,” she thinks, but she’s not sure if she’s on pace to hit her yearly goal.

*Late Morning*

While chatting with her book club friends, Clara hears about several new releases. “You have to read this one next!” her friend says. Clara adds it to the long list of recommendations she’s scribbled in her journal, but she knows she’ll lose track of it soon.

*Lunch*

Over lunch, Clara scrolls through her bookshelf app to see what she owns. She realizes she’s accidentally bought duplicates of the same book before. “I need a way to track what I already have,” she mutters.

*Afternoon*

Later, Clara sets aside time to read, but she struggles to remember the key points of a book she finished last month. “If I had logged my thoughts, it would be easier to revisit,” she thinks.

*Evening*

As the day winds down, Clara reflects on her reading challenge. “I’ve made great progress, but I want a tool to track what I’ve read, what I own, and what’s next on my list,” she resolves.
